    Start by cloning the entire repo
    Must hard code the paths for train-ham/spam and test-spam/ham directories in the main file
    Compile and javafx window will open, close it and the raw data from our calculations will be displayed
    Might have to pause it to see all data
    Data that is displayed is hamfrequency,spamfrequency, Wi|H, Wi|S, S|Wi and the S|F for the file you hard code in the main.
